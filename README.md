This repo contains my solutions from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

Not all of my solutions are listed. A solution will be listed if it is...

- Interesting and/or difficult or
- I am learning the language, so I want to have a reference to the code, even if it's trivial.

My coding style here is a bit hackier (e.g., putting all braces on one line, etc.). Oftentimes, I also try to make it smaller, at the expensive of efficiency, so it is not 100% what I would use in production.

However, compared to other solutions, I think my code is often more **readable** and efficient, except for a few cases.

For most (or all) solutions, I added the test cases into "main" (or outside) so that it can be run by itself. I also added additional comments and/or modified the code slightly, so it is not 100% what I submitted.

Enjoy :)

## Notes
- Sometimes, there is *file2*, *file3*, etc. These are multiple solutions I submitted. Oftentimes, *2*, *3*, etc. are hackier, while the original is less hacky.
- For Java solutions, I sometimes renamed the files/classes so that there would not be conflicts and the names would be more descriptive.

I did not add the license to the top of each file, like I usually do (and is the recommended practice), because I wanted the files to be small and quickly viewable (like scripts). However, every file in this repo is under this license, so do not be afraid to use any of the code here in a project that is compatible with this license.
